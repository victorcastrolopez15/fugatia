Generate multiple Pages, Posts and Custom Post Types using dynamic content.

== Description ==

Page Generator Pro allows you to generate multiple Pages, Posts or Custom Post Types, each with their own variation of a base content template.  

Variations can be produced by using keywords, which contain multiple words or phrases that are then cycled through for each Page that is generated.

Generate multiple Pages, Posts or CPT's in bulk by defining:

* Page Title
* Page Slug / Permalink
* Content
* Publish status (Draft or Publish)
* Number of Pages to generate
* Author
